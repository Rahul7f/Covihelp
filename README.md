About Idea:

Nowadays, whenever we want to help people, we just donate money to charities or somewhere else. But in many cases, we can’t trace where our money is used or if by mistake if we donate the money to the wrong charity our money that we gave to help the needy might even get laundered for some violent works or not get used for the purpose for what we donated

So to make this transparency we have developed an application. The main idea of our application is to provide help directly to the individuals or ask for help from the community. Our application provides facilities to both the helpers and the needy to ask for help or directly help the individual.

To show respect to the helpers, we call them warriors as they are helping society with their help.

  

About the app:

We have divides our app into four sections as follow:

  

1.  Help others: in this section, the user can see the needy people i.e the who need help.
    

In this section a list containing the type of help needed by the needy for example if the individual needs ventilator or oxygen (and many other categories are available). A helper can also filter the list according to category.

The helper is also able to filter the list based on distance i.e the nearest needy will be shown at the top of the list.

This list can be viewed by anyone without the need for sign-up.

  

2.  Warriors: as we have already told the warriors are the people who volunteer for providing help. These are the heroes of our society who help others.
    

This section contains the list of warriors and details of the kind of help they can provide like food, medicine, etc.

Warrior can be an individual or a charity (verified).

This list can also be filtered based on location and also based on the type of help.

Our app verifies the information before it gets post so that only genuine posts get displayed.

  

3.  Account: this section contains two options as follow:
    

1.  Be a Warrior: this option allows individuals/charities to be a warrior i.e to post to help others. These posts will be shown under the warrior’s section.
    
2.  Get help: this option allows individuals to signup and ask for help
    

These posts will be shown under the help other section.

  

4. Vaccine: this option is in the beta stage this option currently shows the details of  the Number of individuals vaccinated, the availability of the vaccine, and the  nearest vaccine center and slots available.
